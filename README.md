# LetsDefend Simulated SOC Project
Simulated SOC Analyst Lab using LetsDefend ‚Äì Threat Detection, Log Analysis & Incident Response
This project documents my hands-on experience in a simulated SOC environment through the LetsDefend simulated SOC platform. 
It includes real-world security incident investigations such as phishing, malware, and exploitation attacks.

I performed alert triage, log analysis, EDR investigation, and threat classification based on MITRE ATT&CK techniques. 
The goal is to develop SOC analyst skills in a realistic, interactive lab environment using tools like SIEM, endpoint security, email analysis, and threat intel modules.
