## üß† Analyst Summary

A phishing email pretending to offer a free upgrade to Windows 11 Pro was sent from a spoofed/malicious sender. The email redirected the victim to a fake update website that hosted a disguised script (`maloy.mp4`) which utilized `mshta.exe` to deliver the **Lumma Stealer** payload via **DLL side-loading**. Post-access, the system showed indicators of credential harvesting and data exfiltration attempts, confirmed by EDR logs and threat intelligence tools.
